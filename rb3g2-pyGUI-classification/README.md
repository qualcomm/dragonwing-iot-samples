# üß† RB3 Gen 2 Image Classification

This sample application is written in python to show how to use a classification model on the RB3 Gen2 development platform. The [RB3 Gen2](https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-70020-253/qsg-landing-page.html?product=1601111740013077&facet=Quick%20Start%20Guide) device, a development platform designed to accelerate computing and connectivity capabilities for consumer and industrial IoT (Internet of Things) devices. The app can run on both Ubuntu 22.04 and [Qualcomm Linux 1.4](https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-70018-115/qualcomm-linux-docs-home.html?vproduct=1601111740013072&version=1.4). It allows users to select an image, run inference, and view the top 4 predictions with confidence bars in a graphical interface. The classification model is a quantized GoogLeNet[LiteRT](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert) model, formerly known as TensorFlow Lite, Google's high-performance runtime for on-device AI.

## üñ•Ô∏è Requirements

### RB3 Gen2 Device
Follow RB3 Gen2 vision kit set up [instructions](https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-70020-251/set_up_the_device.html?product=1601111740013077&facet=User%20Guide) 

### Classification Model and Labels
Download:
- TFLite GoogLeNet-Quantized model from [AIHub](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/googlenet?domain=Computer+Vision&useCase=Image+Classification)
- Imagenet dataset [labels](https://github.com/quic/ai-hub-models/blob/main/qai_hub_models/labels/imagenet_labels.txt)

## üéÆ Platform OS Setup:

### Ubuntu:
Clone the project directly on your RB3 Gen2
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cyberZil/rb3g2-pyGUI-classification.git
   cd rb3g2-pyGUI-classification
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Qualcomm Linux:
Clone repository on your host machine and push files to RB3 Gen 2:
   ```bash
   adb push rb3g2-pyGUI-classification /opt
   ```

## üìÅ File Structure on Device
```
main.py                    # Main application script
googlenet_quantized.tflite # TFLite model file (required)
imagenet_labels.txt        # Label file (required)
MainWindowPic.jpg          # Default image
requirements.txt           # Libraries needed to run app
```

---

## üöÄ How to Run App on RB3 Gen 2
After going to the folder where you cloned the repo or /opt for Qualcomm Linux run the following command
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

- To use a different model, update the `TF_MODEL` and `LABELS` constants in the script.
- You can replace `MainWindowPic.jpg` with your own default image.
- Modify the `runInference()` function to support additional output tensors or model types.
